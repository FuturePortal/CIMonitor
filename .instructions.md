# CIMonitor

CIMonitor is a web application that catches CI processes and displays them in a clean overview.

The application is built with:

- Parcel typescript for building the frontend (`./frontend/`)
- NodeJS express backend for serving the frontend and providing API endpoints (`./backend/`)

# Instructions for AI

- Think about solutions to solve the problem before starting to make changes.
- If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user’s request, use your tools to read
  files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.
- When there is multiple options, always ask the user first what option to proceed with.
- Start every message with; "Using `./.instructions.md` with your request 🚧"
- End every task with; "Finished 🏁 Be critical of my output and provide feedback for code style and logic improvements
  before committing 🚯⚠️"
- Check for errors in the editor before finishing.

# Overall coding rules

- Variable names must be clear and descriptive. Never use abbreviations.
- Code readability is prioritized over cleverness.
- Follow clean code principles.
- Clean up no longer relevant code where possible.
- Everything is strongly typed using Typescript.
- Every component is set up mobile first. Styles are added upon breakpoints when needed.
- Components are split up in small, reusable components.
  - Helper functions are put in a `./helpers/` directory. A file per function that's exported as default.
  - Hooks are put in a `./hooks/` directory. A file per hook that's exported as default.
- Don't add unnecessary comments. If the code is not clear, refactor it until it is.
