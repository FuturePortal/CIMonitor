# CIMonitor version 4

CIMonitor is a place where all your CI statuses come together. Check if all tests have passed, and if
deployments are successful. All in one overview. This is all done via **webhooks**, so no complex configuration.

The time that deployments were scary is over, lets make them FUN!
