# Getting started with CIMonitor

Running CIMonitor can be done multiple ways. The easiest to get started is running CIMonitor with docker. On this page
you find more information on the environment variables that you can set for your CIMonitor instance, that affect the
way your CIMonitor is behaving.

## Running CIMonitor

To start running CIMonitor, pick one of the following options and continue there:

-   [Run as docker container](./run/docker.md)
-   [Run in Kubernetes](./run/kubernetes.md)
-   [Run locally with node(js)](./run/locally.md)

## Setting environment variables

It's important to know that you need to set environment variables on your application to run CIMonitor the way you
desire. To see what variables can be set and what the defaults are, check the
[environment configuration](./config/environment.md).
